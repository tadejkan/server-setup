* CRON script for notifying about low disk space
	* how to prevent daily spamming?
	* perhaps weekly notifications when disk space less than 15%, and daily when less than 5% ?
* daily/weekly stats
	* CPU usage
	* memory usage
	* network transfer
	* current disk space
	* ... ?
	* backup stats
* better performance charts
	* Prometheus?
* Docker support
* notifications regarding CRON errors
	* sites were not backed up
	* new SSL certificate was not generated
* find better way of uploading files for sites, instead of SSH-ing using site's username and password
	* when not using auto deployment
